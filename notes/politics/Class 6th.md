##Reasons for diversity

##Indian Diversity

Fishing nets called Cheena-vala, utensils called cheenachatti suggest chinese influece.
- All major 8 religions, 1600 languages, more than 100 dance forms.

##Unity in Diversity

#Diversity and descrimination

##Difference and prejudice
- People form opinions about others who are not like them
- Prejudice due to preconceived notions about life in villages or in cities and thus seeing each other in negative light; villagers being unclean, illiterate etc. Or city dwellers being stingy, unfriendly, lazy. Prejudice causes us to avoid friendships or at times inflict hurt upon others.

##Stereotypes
- Stereotypes stop us from looking at each person as unique individual with his or her own special skills. It also causes us to stop trying things that are not part of the sterotype cast upon us.
- We have stereotypes about girls, boys, people with special needs; stereotypes about people from a religion being wealthy or violent, or from a region beign stingy etc; stereotypes about geographies like North Indians, South Indians, Bengali, Gujarati, Marathi etc.

##Inequality and Discrimination
- When people act on stereotypes or prejudices they tend to discriminate on basis of gender, religion or region. Undue preferences are given or sometimes utter ignorance is displayed. Also a route cause of the social problems remains undiscovered due to stereotypes; eg. Muslim girls being not interested in education, but the real reason being the poverty that makes them avoid education.
- People are discriminated against based on the occupation, our caste system is mainly responsible for this.
- Dalit means broken

##Striving for equality
- Fights by dalits to secure entry into temples and gain access to public ponds and wells. Fight by peasants, tribals to rid themselves from the grasp of money lenders.
- Untouchability is a crime and abolished by law.
- All religions are treated equally by the state.

#Government
An entity entrusted with the administration, development and protection of a large geographical area called a country and welfare of it's diverse citizens.
- Roads, Railways, food price regulation, social inequalities, post, boundaries, disaster management

###Levels of government
National, Central, Local

##Laws and the government
Government cannot enforce it's decisons without laws. Negligience of a law can be contested in a court of law. People need to sometimes struggle for their rights against the government itself; During first world war Women in Europe struggled against government for right to vote. The movement was called Suffrage movement.

#Democratic Government
- South African people suffered from apartheid, where black coloured people, Indian and other coloured people were discriminated against by the white people. They did not have a right to vote. There were separate systems for everything from hospitals, ambulance, bus stops to townships. Many people died in the struggle against the system. Finally South Africa became democracy in 1994 after long peaceful struggle.

- In democracy people can make their voice be heard via Dharnas, rallies, strikes, signature campaigns etc. If a country's people are alert and interested in how the country is run, the democratic character of that government will be stronger.

- Cauvery water dispute between Karnataka and Tamilnadu around Kshirsagar and Mettur Dam water capacity.

- Equality and justice.

#Panchayati Raj
