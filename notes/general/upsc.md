questions on matters of general interest. The object of the interview is to assess the personal suitability of the candidate for
a career in public service by a Board of competent and unbiased observers. The test is intended to judge the mental calibre
of a candidate. In broad terms this is really an assessment of not only his/her intellectual qualities but also social traits and
his/her interest in current affairs. Some of the qualities to be judged are mental alertness, critical powers of assimilation,
clear and logical exposition, balance of judgement, variety and depth of interest, ability for social cohesion and leadership,
intellectual and moral integrity.

conversation which is intended to reveal the mental qualities of the candidate.
3. The interview test is not intended to be a test either of the specialised or general knowledge of the candidates which has
been already tested through their written papers. Candidates are expected to have taken an intelligent interest not only in
their special subjects of academic study but also in the events which are happening around them both within and outside
their own state or country as well as in modern currents of thought and in new discoveries which should rouse the curiosity
of well educated youth.
